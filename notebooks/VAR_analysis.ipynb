    "## Vector Autoregression (VAR) Model for Economic and Financial Data Analysis\n",
    "This jupyter notebook provides an example of how to perform a Vector Autoregression (VAR) analysis on economic and financial data for a specific country. \n",
    "The data is sourced from two CSV files: 'world_bank_data.csv' and 'stock_data.csv' (downloaded from data.py file).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Merging datasets\n",
    "The 'world_bank_data.csv' file contains economic data from the World Bank, while 'stock_data.csv' contains financial data. The two datasets are merged based on the year and the country code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 'var_country' function\n",
    "The var_country function is the core of this script. It takes as input the merged data and a country code, and performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Preprocessing: The function first selects the 'value' and 'Close' columns from the data, which represent the economic and financial indicators, respectively. These columns are converted to numeric types and then standardized using the StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Filtering: The function then filters the data for the specified country. If no data is available for the country, or if the data contains NaN or infinite values, the function returns an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stationarity Check: Before applying the VAR model, the function checks if the time series are stationary using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test. If the p-value is greater than 0.05, the function suggests differencing the series and returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- VAR Model: If the series are stationary, the function creates a VAR model using the VAR class from statsmodels.tsa.vector_ar.var_model. It fits the model with a maximum lag order of 12, selected based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Results: Finally, the function prints the summary of the VAR model, which includes the coefficients, standard errors, t-statistics, and p-values for each predictor, as well as some overall model fit statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "To use this script, simply replace 'DEU' with your desired country code in the last line of the script, and then run the script. The output will be the VAR model summary for the specified country.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Vector Autoregression (VAR) model was used to analyze the data for Germany (DEU). The model was fitted with a maximum lag order of 12, selected based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the 'value' equation, the most significant predictor is the first lag of 'value' itself (L1.value), with a coefficient of 0.997370 and a p-value of 0.000, indicating strong evidence against the null hypothesis of the coefficient being zero. However, the coefficients for other lags of 'value' and 'Close' are not statistically significant (p-values are close to 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the 'Close' equation, the constant term and the lags of 'Close' are statistically significant (p-values close to 0). The coefficients for the lags of 'value' are not statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation matrix of residuals shows a very low correlation between the residuals of 'value' and 'Close', suggesting that there is little linear relationship left in the residuals of the two series, which is a good sign for the model fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the interpretation of VAR model results can be complex and requires a good understanding of the subject matter and the data. The statistical significance of a variable does not necessarily imply its practical significance. It's also important to check other diagnostic measures and consider the model's assumptions and limitations."
